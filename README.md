# AngularWeatherForecastApp

This is just a demo application on Angular.js to showcase my basic skills on Angular.js. 
For beginners to learn how this app works, you can refer https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/#/ course just like me.
Angular App fetches data from www.openweathermap.org/api. You need to generate your own API key and replace it with the keywords 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' inside service.js file.
